                            <p class="gray">With the introduction of delivery cycle metrics, lapses in quality are no longer excusable. Due to the granular view that these metrics provide, leaders can see exact instances where their delivery cycle needs improvement. The pioneers in this space are doing everything they can to eliminate these deficiencies, to drive greater quality in the future.

                            <p class="gray">Much like the practice of enterprise software delivery itself, traceability is complex and fast becoming one of the biggest technical headaches for organizations worldwide. Itâs easy to see why. Think of all those concurrent product lines. All those evolving features. All that mutable product information that specialist teams create and depend on during different stages of the process. Think of how the essence of Agile means requirements constantly evolve from backlog to deployed.

Think of all the planning, articulating, building, testing and deploying. The ongoing customer feedback. The second iteration, the third, fourth, fifth and so on. Think of all that honing, continuous collaborative development. Few things are static in software delivery. Being able to capture every activity matters.</p>
                        </li>
                                            <li class="accordion-tab sr-c-l">
                            <span>Real time dashboards</span>
                            <p class="gray">Software development teams need to be able to track metrics instantly. The second something happens with the product â whether itâs down time or a service disruption â the real time information team needs to respond. Dashboards enable development teams to monitor their product and respond in real-time, track metrics, including: up and down times, response times, load times, errors, development work items, and more.</p>
                        </li>

                            <p class="gray">As data centers grow in size and complexity, IT event correlation and management becomes more challenging. Some challenges stem from IT silos, in which different network, server, and storage teams monitor events using their own tools and processes.

Businesses need a single, unified view of your IT environment and the ability to automate the execution of analytics, such as the correlation of events and performance data with topology from end-to-end and top to bottom.</p>
                        </li>

                            <p class="gray">Automated ticket triage solutions are successfully used by many organizations to better leverage their own data resources and to keep pace with rising customer expectations.  With intuitive interfaces and comprehensive approaches to support functionalities, automation results in faster, more intelligent and more engaging customer service and support. </p>

                            <p class="gray">More and more organizations are recognizing that Continuous Delivery and Release Automation tools are critical for enterprises that want to achieve the full business value of their software delivery cycle. These tools provide the automation and standardization that organizations need to optimize the software pipeline, rapidly deliver high quality applications, and differentiate in competitive markets.</p>

                            <p class="gray">In the past, most of the release managerâs work was concentrated on the planning, development, and testing phases. Todayâs release manager activities are heavily focused on the operations sideâfor example, building an automated pipeline and process to ensure that the code will be safely propagated to production. Whereas previously the primary release manager interfaces were development and QA, todayâs release manager has many more interfaces to deal with, including operations, customer success, support, sales, product management, and marketing.</p>
                        </li>

                            <p class="gray">Represents an easy way to orchestrate, automate and manage your end-to-end software release pipelines without stopping you from taking full advantage of the unique blend of tools and practices youâve developed and employed. You can model your software development and release process as a sequence of phases and steps. You can save models as templates and you can string them together however you see fit.The end result is a complete pipeline that can be triggered at the push of a button.
</p>
                        </li>

                            <span>Release Rollout/Rollback</span>
                            <p class="gray">Introduce a brand new feature using a feature flag, and then, leveraging target groups, you can expose users gradually to it. Measure its performance with just a few users, then crank up the dial to dozens or hundreds, evaluating every step of the way. If you hit a problem, you can simply turn the news feature off. Or you can roll back gradually as well, getting back to safe levels while fixing the problem.
In a world where downtime is no longer acceptable, you canât afford big bang deployment or other risky rollout strategies. Use gradual rollout to deploy new features and functionality with confidence.

</p>
                        </li>

                            <p class="gray">The technical steps in threat modelling involve answering questions: - What are we working on - What can go wrong - What will we do with the findings - Did we do a good job? The work to answer these questions is embedded in some sort of process, ranging from incredibly informal Kanban with Post-its on the wall to strictly structured waterfalls.
The effort, work, and timeframes spent on threat modelling relate to the process in which engineering is happening and products/services are delivered. The idea that threat modelling is waterfall or âheavyweightâ is based on threat modelling approaches from the early 2000s. Modern threat modelling building blocks fit well into agile and are in wide use. </p>

                            <p class="gray">If you continuously vet the application for security issues from the outset of development, it is highly unlikely that a major security concern would arise toward the end of the delivery pipeline. Itâs more likely that only minor security concerns would exist as the application development process comes to a close. This is a direct result of providing visibility into the applicationâs quality by continuously verifying that security standards are being implemented properlyâa huge time-saver (and potentially huge money-saver) down the line.

It prevents attacks by âself-protectingâ or re-configuring automatically without human intervention in response to certain conditions (threats, faults, etc.). 

Automated Run-time Defense comes into play when the application is executed, causing the program to monitor itself and detect malicious input and behavior.

By moving beyond security only at the perimeter of a network or an endpoint, Automated Run-time Defense enables applications to defend themselves.</p>

The data-generation part is made of generators, and vulnerability identification relies on debugging tools. Generators usually use combinations of static fuzzing vectors (known-to-be-dangerous values), or totally random data. New generation fuzzers use genetic algorithms to link injected data and observed impact.</p>

Maintaining database and middleware environments is daunting, given the complexity and the volume of tasks supported. IT teams struggle to meet service levels for middleware and database patching, database upgrades, middleware and database provisioning and code release. They also find it difficult to enforce standards and stay compliant. Valuable DBA time is spent on executing mundane and repetitive tasks. Efforts to automate via scripting fall short as they lack central control, consistency and require lots of maintenance. Such a situation does not position IT teams to execute on new initiatives like Cloud based services.</p>

DEVOPS
To succeed in this decade, enterprises are working overtime to leverage new technologies and methodologies, to accelerate innovation. However, they are increasingly finding it difficult to derive the true worth of an application when operations and development teams work in silos.

Previously, software used to be âtossed across the wallâ to operations/ infrastructure, for deployment and other services. As a result, resolving unforeseen and tricky challenges needed many iterations between multiple groups, resulting in unmet deadlines and unproductive deployments.

After all, nothing is more frustrating than unveiling the new version of an exciting new app â only to have its wheels fall off â when the actual downloading happens.

Changing Software Behavior â One Mindset At A Time
Globally, it has been proven that DevOps needs 35% less IT workforce and 30% lower IT costs.

At S-Square Systems, we realize DevOps is more than a mindset than technological practice.

We amplify this benefit by getting our team of software developers, quality assurance experts, and infrastructure administrators to collaborate throughout the development cycle proactively.

Our extensive experience and expertise in DevOps empowers us to provide our customers with end-to-end DevOps services spanning planning; strategy managed services and execution.
